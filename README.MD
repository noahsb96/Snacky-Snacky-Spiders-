## Project Choice
Snacky Snacky Spiders
## Project Description
Your tarantulas are hungry! They are engaging in a competition to determine who the alpha spider is. Player one has to use the c key and z key and Player two has to use the right arrow and left arrow keys. Each spider moves side to side to determine which one gets the most crickets in the 60 second time period. Watch as your tarantulas devour crickets coming down the screen.
## User Stories
As player one, I would like to use the left shift and z key to move from the very left to the very right to catch as many crickets as possible
As player two I would like to use the right and left arrow keys to move from the very right to the very left to catch as many crickets as possible
As a player I would like to have my spider eat a scricket once it is directly below one
As a player I would like there to be a time limit so the game is as competitive as possible against my opponent
As a player I would like the game to keep track of how many crickets I have and show the score at the top of the screen
As a player I would like the game to have crickets come down fast enough for the game to be challenging but not so fast that I can't catch any crickets
As a player I would like instructions on how to play the game so both me and my opponent know what we are doing so we can have fun
### MVP Goals
Have two spiders on a screen that can both move from side to side utilizing the corresponding keys on the keyboard. I want the spiders to be able to catch crickets that I have coming down a screen and have the game keep track of the amount of crickets eaten by each spider
### Stretch Goals
Sound effects added when a spider catches a cricket, background music, a moving background picture, and moving spider images. Also have a clock counting down from 60 appear once the player clicks start
